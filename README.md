Hi,

To be able to run the project, download it, put it in the database folder (I use xampp (mysql)), so in /xampp/htdocs.
2. use the 'composer update' command to create the vendor folder.
3. Create the .env folder, based on .env.example. First of all, set the information related to the database, about email information (for email verification)
4. Make sure you have the respective version of php 8.1.25
4. To run the project, go to the project folder and run the command 'php artisan serve'

Below I have added a video that shows all the required functionalities.
